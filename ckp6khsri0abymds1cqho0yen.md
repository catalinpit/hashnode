## Track Job Applications With Notion API, Node.js and FastifyJS

Notion is a productivity software that allows you to create systems for knowledge management, project management and note-taking.

They recently released their API to the public. You can use the API to integrate your Notion data to any application you want.

Thus, this article shows you to:
* build an Node.js API with Notion
* use FastifyJS to create the API

Without further ado, let's start configuring your Notion workspace.

---

# Create integrations on Notion

Go to your [Notion integrations](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations) and create a new integration by clicking on the "+ New Integration" button. After that, you will be prompted to fill three fields:

* the name of your project
* a logo for the project
* choose an associated workspace

> ![Notion API setting my integrations](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621838874550/TjS7uvVT3.png)
Figure 1

Figure 1 above illustrates the set-up process. After filling all the fields, click on the "Submit" button to create the integration.

Once you click the submit button, your integration should be created. You will be redirected to another page, from where you can grab your "**Internal Integration Token
**". Figure 2 shows that.

> ![Notion API dashboard of my integrations](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621495170529/nJs-govu5.png)
Figure 2

Before going further, it's important to note that you need to leave "**Internal integration**" checked, as you can see in figure 2.

For a **more in-depth** tutorial about creating Notion integrations, I recommend checking their [official documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs).

---

# Share your Notion pages

The last step is to share whatever page you wish with the newly-created integration. Go to your Notion account, and choose any page you want.

After the page opens, click on the "*Share*" button, and then click on the field saying "*Add people, emails, groups, or integrations*".

Figure 3, below, illustrates that.

> ![notion dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621495508094/tPJWoWmzO.png)
Figure 3

After clicking on that field, you are prompted to choose with whom you want to share the page. Choose your integration. In my case, I share the "My space" page with my integration called "My notion space".

> ![share notion space with people](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621495611898/SaXRDTfpM.png)
Figure 4

That's all you need to do when it comes to configuring Notion, so well done! You are done with the Notion configuration, and you are ready to use the Notion API.

**Note**: If you want to use the same document as me, you can duplicate this [job applications template](https://www.notion.so/6c73f893f4c74718982504d36a6c43bb?v=345b93c08725486097551607ef394b8c). After you duplicate it, share it with your integration (*see the process above*) and use your database ID (*you'll see how to get the database ID later*).

---

# Configure the Node.js project
You need to use the Notion SDK for JavaScript to interact with the Notion API in your Node.js application. The Notion SDK is a client for the Notion API, and you can find more about it on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js).

The first step is to create the application structure. Create a new folder and initialize the application as follows:

```
mkdir notion-api-app

cd notion-api-app

npm init -y
```

The command `npm init -y` creates the package.json file and initialises it with the default values. If you want to fill the fields manually, remove the -y flag and follow the instructions.

The next step is to install the packages required to create the application. You'll use the following packages:

* **Notion SDK** - to interact with the Notion API.
* **FastifyJS** - to build the Node.js API.
* **dotenv** - to manage environmental variables.

Thus, you can install the packages as follows:

```
npm install @notionhq/client fastify dotenv
```

Once the packages are installed, you need to create a file to store the environmental variables. You will store the Notion secret token and the database ID in the `.env` file. Thus, create the `.env` file as follows:

```
touch .env
```

Now go to [your Notion integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations) and click on your integration. You should see a field called **Internal Integration Token** (see figure 2 for reference). Click on the "Show" button and copy the token. 

The next step is to go to your `.env` file and add the token:

```
NOTION_TOKEN=<your_token>
``` 

**Note**: Replace `<your_token>` with the token you copied earlier.

Before going further, you also need to create the folder structure for the application. You need to create the following folders:
* **src** - it hosts all the other folders.
* **routes** - the home folder for your routes.
* **notion** - the Notion client resides here.
* **controllers** - the home folder for your business logic.

You can create all the folders and files from the command line as follows:

```
mkdir src
mkdir src/routes src/notion src/controllers
touch src/routes/routes.js
touch src/notion/client.js
touch src/controllers/controllers.js
```

This is how the structure of your application should look like until this point:

<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621964996163/MeIroa2x9.png" alt="Notion App folder structure" width="350" />

Now you are ready to build the application!

---

# Configure Notion in the application

It's time to configure the Notion client so you can use it to manipulate data. Go into the following file `src/notion/client.js` and add the following code:

```
const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');

require('dotenv').config();
```

With the first line, you import the Notion client, and with the second one, you import the `dotenv` package. The purpose of these imports is to allow you to use the Notion client and the environmental variables.

The next step is to create a new Notion client. In the same file, after the imports, write the following code:

```
const notion = new Client({
    auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN
});
```

With the above code, you create a new instance of the Notion client and pass your secret token. Lastly, you store it in the `notion` constant so you can re-use the client.

Before going further, you need to export the `notion` constant so you can use it when you write the business logic. In the same file - `src/notion/client.js` -, at the end, write the following code:

```
module.exports = {
    notion
};
```

Now you are ready to use the Notion client.

> Check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/catalinpit/1cd4f8973fa6604fe2c856a3c939ec87) to see how your file `client.js` file should look up to this point.

### How to get the database ID

There is one more step before building the routes. You need the database ID so you can perform operations such as:
* creating, reading, and modifying data

You can get the database ID in two ways. You can either **do it from the browser** or **programmatically**.

If you prefer to do it from the browser, open the Notion document in your browser and copy the ID as shown in figure 5.

> ![Get the database ID in Notion](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621924719940/-7ciaseNr.png)
Figure 5

Alternatively, you can get the database ID programmatically, as shown in the snippet below:

```
const getDatabases = async () => {
    const databases = await notion.databases.list();

    console.log(databases);
};
```

The above code snippet lists all your databases and the information about them. For a visual representation, see figure 6 below.

> ![How to retrieve the Notion database ID programmatically](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621961967920/T_iLnUQdD.png)
Figure 6

Whatever option you end up using, copy the database ID and add it to your `.env` file. At this point, your `.env` file  should look as follows:

```
NOTION_TOKEN=<your_token>
DB_ID=<your_DB_ID>
```

You finished configuring the Notion client in your project. The next step is to create the routes and business logic.

---

# Add FastifyJS

Open the file `app.js` and import FastifyJS at the top of the file.

```
const app = require('fastify')({ logger: true });
```

After that, import the "dotenv" package again so you can use the port, which is defined in the `.env.` file.

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

The next step is to register the routes, even though you did not write them yet. After the imports, add the following line:

```
app.register(require('./src/routes/routes'));
```

With the above line, you register all the routes. That is, you make the routes available so users can access them. 

Lastly, listen to a port so you can run the application. Add the following code at the bottom of the file:

```
app.listen(process.env.PORT, (err, addr) => {
    if (err) {
        app.log.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
    }

    app.log.info(`Your server is listening on port ${process.env.PORT} ðŸ§¨`);
});
```

The application listens to a port you define in the `.env` file. If there is an error, it logs the error. Otherwise, it outputs in the console that the server is running and on which port it is running.

Thus, add the port number - 3333 - in your `.env` file. This port number is just an example; you can use any port number you want. By this point, your `.env` file should look as follows:

```
NOTION_TOKEN=<your_token>
DB_ID=<your_DB_ID>
PORT=3333
```

> Check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/catalinpit/e63824b86d13a736fd8efa6cccadde15) to see how your file `app.js` file should look up to this point.

---

# Build the routes

The next step is to create the routes. Their purpose is to allow people to perform CRUD operations (*except deleting data in this tutorial*).

For the beginning, go to `src/routes/routes.js` and import the controller at the top of the file.

```
const controller = require('../controllers/controllers');
```

Even though you did not write the business logic yet, you will need it. After that, create the `routes` function and export it:

```
async function routes(app, opts) {
    // the code for routes go here
};

module.exports = routes;
```

In the `routes` method, you configure your application's endpoints. For each route, you specify, at minimum, the:
* **HTTP method** - for instance, you use the `GET` HTTP verb to return all items in your database.
* **URL** - for example, you might use the endpoint `/job/applications` to return all the job applications.
* **handler** - this represents the business logic. For example, what happens when people access the endpoint `/job/applications`.

Now that you understand how routes work in FastifyJS, let's build the first route. 

#### Show all job applications

The first route shows all job applications when a user makes a `GET` request to the endpoint `/job/applications`.

```
app.route({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/job/applications',
    handler: controller.getAllApplications
});
```

#### Get a specific job application

The second route shows only one job application. When the user makes a `GET` request to the `/job/applications/:id` route, it shows only the job application whose ID matches the provided ID in the URL. 

Write the following code after the first route:

```
app.route({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/job/applications/:id',
    handler: controller.getApplication
});
```

#### Filter job applications

The third route allows the users to filter the job applications by the company name. The user can use a query parameter called `company` to filter the results. 

An example of a URL would be `/job/applications/filter?company="CatalinSoft"`. Thus, by making a `GET` request to that URL, the application returns only the job application for the company "CatalinSoft". 

Write the following code in `routes.js`:

```
app.route({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/job/applications/filter',
    handler: controller.filterApplications
});
```

#### Add a new job application

The fourth route allows people to make a `POST` request to add job applications into the document. When you make a `POST` request to the endpoint `'/job/applications'`, with the appropriate body, it adds the job application to the Notion document.

Write the following code:

```
app.route({
    method: 'POST',
    url: '/job/applications',
    handler: controller.addApplication
});
```

#### Update existing application

Lastly, you have the route which allows people to update an existing job application. Make a `PATCH` request to `/job/applications/:id` with the appropriate body, and you will update the record.

```
app.route({
    method: 'PATCH',
    url: '/job/applications/:id',
    handler: controller.updateApplication
});
```

Those are all the routes. As you can see, they follow the same pattern:
1. You specify the HTTP method.
2. You add the URL where people can make the request.
3. You provide the handler which is triggered when a request is made to that route.

Also, you might've noticed that there is no "delete" route. That is because the Notion API does not allow you to delete resources at the moment.

# Add the business logic

The last step of the tutorial is to build the business logic. The business logic specifies what happens when a certain HTTP request is made to a specific endpoint.

Let's start by importing the Notion client in the `controllers.js` file. Open the file and add the following line at the top of the document:

```
const { notion } = require('../notion/client');
```

Now, you can use the client to manipulate data.

## Retrieve all job applications

The first method you write is the one that returns all the job applications. Write the following code in `controllers.js`:

```
const getAllApplications = async (req, res) => {
    const data = await notion.databases.query({
        database_id: process.env.DB_ID
    });
}
```

Up to this point, you use the Notion client to query your database. The above piece of code returns an object, which in turn contains an array with all the pages from your database.

This is the result you get if you run the above code:

```
{
  object: 'list',
  results: [
    {
      object: 'page',
      id: '8e8e8f35-09ac-40fd-92a2-a3743b271e2e',
      created_time: '2021-05-26T05:45:00.000Z',
      last_edited_time: '2021-05-26T05:45:00.000Z',
      parent: [Object],
      archived: false,
      properties: [Object]
    },
    {
      object: 'page',
      id: '03a7aea1-c58b-49ce-9843-87131c37192a',
      created_time: '2021-05-25T06:10:08.816Z',
      last_edited_time: '2021-05-25T06:10:08.816Z',
      parent: [Object],
      archived: false,
      properties: [Object]
    }
  ],
  next_cursor: null,
  has_more: false
}
```

From this response, the field `results` is the one that interests you. That's the array with all the pages from your database.

Since you have an array, you need to loop over it and return only the pages. Go back to the method `getAllApplications` and add the rest of the code:

```js
const getAllApplications = async (req, res) => {
    const data = await notion.databases.query({
        database_id: process.env.DB_ID
    });

    const pages = data.results.map(page => {
        return {
            id: page.id,
            created: page.created_time,
            updated: page.last_edited_time,
            company: page.properties.Company.title[0].plain_text,
            position: page.properties.Position.select.name,
            status: page.properties.Status.select.name,
            deadline: page.properties['Next Deadline'].date.start,
            jobDescription: page.properties['Job Description'].url,
            comments: page.properties.Comments.rich_text[0].plain_text
        }
    });

    return pages;
};
```

In the second part of the code, you map over the `results` array and return an array of custom objects. These custom objects contain the following information:
* the ID
* when it was created
* when it was last updated
* the company name
* the position you applied for
* the status of the application
* the application deadline
* the job description
* additional comments

Let's make a `GET` request to `localhost:3333/job/applications` and see what happens.

> ![Notion API HTTP GET Request](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622036626300/CaFTAZnH1.png)
Figure 7

Figure 7 illustrates what happens after making the request. You can see it returns an array of objects, exactly how you structured them in the method `getAllApplications`.

## Get a specific application

The next step is to add the business logic for retrieving only a specific job application. This time, you use different methods. Rather than querying a database, you retrieve a specific page.

Write the following method in your file `controller.js`:

```js
const getApplication = async (req, res) => {
    const page = await notion.pages.retrieve({
        page_id: req.params.id
    });

    return {
        id: page.id,
        created: page.created_time,
        updated: page.last_edited_time,
        company: page.properties.Company.title[0].plain_text,
        position: page.properties.Position.select.name,
        status: page.properties.Status.select.name,
        deadline: page.properties['Next Deadline'].date.start,
        jobDescription: page.properties['Job Description'].url,
        comments: page.properties.Comments.rich_text[0].plain_text
    };
};
```

The method takes the ID of the page from the URL. Thus, if you make a `GET` request to the URL `http://localhost:3333/job/applications/8e8e8f35-09ac-40fd-92a2-a3743b271e2e`, the method takes the page ID from it.

After that, it returns the page whose ID matches the ID provided in the URL. Let's make a request and see what happens.

> ![Notion API GET Requst](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622037399984/3z7RevC_P.png)
Figure 8

Figure 8 illustrates that it returns the custom page object you defined in the method `getApplication`.

## Filter applications

The Notion client allows you to filter the data as well. For example, you might want to filter the results by the company name. Thus, you can pass the company name in the URL, and it will only return the job applications for that company.

Write the following code in `controllers.js`:

```js
const filterApplications = async (req, res) => {
    const data = await notion.databases.query({
        database_id: process.env.DB_ID,
        filter: {
            property: 'Company',
            text: {
                contains: req.query.company || ''
            }
        }
    });

    const pages = data.results.map(page => {
        return {
            id: page.id,
            created: page.created_time,
            updated: page.last_edited_time,
            company: page.properties.Company.title[0].plain_text,
            position: page.properties.Position.select.name,
            status: page.properties.Status.select.name,
            deadline: page.properties['Next Deadline'].date.start,
            jobDescription: page.properties['Job Description'].url,
            comments: page.properties.Comments.rich_text[0].plain_text
        }
    });
    
    return pages;
};
```

This method is similar to the first method - `getAllApplications`. The only difference is that you also pass the `filter` property when you query the Notion database. 

Querying the database returns a list object that also contains an array called `results`. The `results` array contains all the matched records. Thus, you map over the `results` array and return an array with custom objects.

As mentioned previously, you filter the results by the company name. If you make a `GET` request to the URL `http://localhost:3333/job/applications/filter?company=Notion`, you will only get the Notion job applications.

> ![Filter data with the Notion API](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622093628740/Wdpof6EmT.png)
Figure 9

Figure 9 illustrates a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3333/job/applications/filter?company=Notion`. You can see that it return only the records that match `?company=Notion`. That is all the Notion job applications.

## Add a new application

So far, you can:
- retrieve and display all the job applications
- access a specific job application
- filter data by the company name

But you also need to add new job applications, right? Thus, in this step, you build the route for adding new job applications.

First of all, write the following code in `controllers.js` and then I will explain what it does:

```js
const addApplication = async (req, res) => {
    const newPage = await notion.pages.create({
        parent: {
            database_id: process.env.DB_ID
        },
        properties: {
            Company: {
                title: [
                    {
                        text: {
                            content: req.body.company
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            Position: {
                select: {
                    name: status
                }
            },
            Status: {
                select: {
                    name: req.body.status
                }
            },
            'Next Deadline': {
                date: {
                    start: req.body.deadline
                }
            },
            'Job Description': {
                url: req.body.url
            },
            Comments: {
                rich_text: [
                    {
                        text: {
                            content: req.body.comments
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    });

    return newPage;
};
```

In the above code snippet, you call the `create` method using the Notion client, and you pass two things:
1. **database parent** - you pass the database parent. You do so by using the database ID from the `.env` file.
2. **properties** - these properties represent the Notion document fields.

After that, for each property, you add the properties passed in the body of the request. Making a `POST` request with the following data:

```
{
    "company": "CatalinsTech",
    "position": "Technical Writer",
    "status": "Applied",
    "deadline": "2021-12-12",
    "url": "https://catalins.tech",
    "comments": "I hope to get the job"
}
```

Adds a new job application to the Notion document. You can see that the job application was added by checking [this link](https://www.notion.so/6c73f893f4c74718982504d36a6c43bb?v=345b93c08725486097551607ef394b8c).

Figure 10 illustrates the POST request made to the URL `http://localhost:3333/job/applications`.

> ![Make a POST request using the Notion API](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1622094685647/k_wy6ONkL.png)
Figure 10

## Update existing application

Updating an existing job application is very similar to adding a new one. There are two main differences:
* you use the **update** method
* you pass the **page ID** rather than the **database ID**

You pass the page ID in the URL. For instance, you will make a `PATCH` request to the `/job/applications/:id` URL where you replace `:id` with the actual ID of the document. You can access the ID from the URL in the request parameters - `req.params.id`.

Write the following code in the `controllers.js` file:

```js
const updateApplication = async (req, res) => {
    const updatedPage = await notion.pages.update({
        page_id: req.params.id,
        properties: {
            Company: {
                title: [
                    {

                        }
                    }
                ]

            Position: {

                            content: req.body.comments
                        }
                    }

    });

    return updatedPage;
};
```

Let's modify the last job application added - to the company `CatalinsTech`. Update the following fields:
* status - update it to **Signed**
* deadline - update it to **2021-05-27**
* comments - update it to **I got the job**

Thus, make a `PATCH` request to `http://localhost:3333/job/applications/32f1f59b-9176-4b4b-ab52-1ce66a77df25` with the following JSON data:

```
{
    "company": "CatalinsTech",
    "position": "Technical Writer",
    "status": "Signed",
    "deadline": "2021-05-27",
    "url": "https://catalins.tech",
    "comments": "I got the job"
}
```

Figure 11 illustrates the request being successful. The job application was updated, and you can check it [here](https://www.notion.so/6c73f893f4c74718982504d36a6c43bb?v=345b93c08725486097551607ef394b8c).

Thus, this is how you can update your existing job applications programmatically.

# How to run the application

You can start the application by running `node app.js` in the root folder.

Once you run that, the application should start and you can make HTTP requests.

However, if you clone the application from GitHub, you need to install the dependencies first. You can do so by running:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

# Conclusion

This the end of the tutorial! You build a Node.js API that allows you to:
1. Create and update job applications
2. Retrieve all job applications
3. Access only a specific job application
4. Filter the job applications by the company name

Unfortunately, the Notion API does not allow us to delete resources. That is why there is no `DELETE` endpoint.
