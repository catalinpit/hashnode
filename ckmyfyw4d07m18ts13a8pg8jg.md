The Odin Project is a great resource, and **the best thing about it, is that you can join a supportive, dedicated community.** They have their own Discord server where you can join and network with like-minded people.

# 3. Blogging communities
These blogging communities are great because you can find a variety of subjects from a variety of writers.

Such a blogging community is Hashnode, where you can read on a variety of topics such as:

* [JavaScript](https://hashnode.com/n/javascript)
* [Python](https://hashnode.com/n/python)
* [Web Development](https://hashnode.com/n/web-development)

These topics are just some examples, but you can find a lot more on Hashnode. Besides that, there are authors of all levels. If you want to read advanced tutorials, you can do so. On the other hand, if you are a beginner and looking for likewise material, you can find that too.

However, there are other blogging communities such as:
* Medium
* HackerNoon
* freeCodeCamp blog

# 4. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
The Khan Academy specifies on their home page that "you can learn anything". That's primarily true because they have an extensive curriculum where you can learn *Computing*
subjects and subjects adjacent to *Computing*.

However, focusing on the Computing subjects, you can use the Khan Academy to learn subjects such as:
* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript
* Algorithms
* Data Structures

# 7. [YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com)
YouTube channels are a great way to learn how to program for free. There are a plethora of channels you can choose from. However, in this article, I will suggest you some searching terms for YouTube instead of specific channels. 

The reason for suggesting searching terms rather than channels is because everyone has their preferences. If I like a channel, you might not. And vice-versa. Thus, by browsing searching terms, you can find the channels you want.

The topics you could search for are:
* Web Development
* Web Design
* Python
* JavaScript
* Java
* Full Stack Tutorial

Of course, these are just a few examples, but the sky is the limit. There is a ton of content for free! Make the most of it.

# 8. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
On Codecademy, you can choose between three areas:
* **Web Development** - This path prepares you to build basic websites and interactive web apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* **Programming and Computer Science** - This path introduces you to the world of programming with Python.
* **Data Science** - It teaches you SQL and Python to build the skills you need to analyze data.

Their free plan provides you with enough lesson. However, if you want access to everything, you can upgrade to the paid plan. **The best thing about Codecademy is that they have a mobile app so you can practice coding on the go!**

# 9. [Edabit](https://edabit.com)
Edabit describes themselves as the Duolingo for learning how to code. They added gamification to make the process of learning more enjoyable. By solving challenges, you gain XP and unlock achievements.

They also have two beginner tutorials that teach you coding with JavaScript or Python, depending on what you want to learn. Once you learn the basics, you can go to the **Challenges** and practice what you learnt! Edabit is a great resource.

# 10. [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)
EDX is one of the best resources because you can learn programming from real college courses created by the world's leading universities, such as Harvard and MIT. And that's for free!

There is no barrier anymore. You do not have to go to the world's leading universities to take their excellent courses. You can do it online. Isn't that great?

On EDX, you can learn essential coding skills needed for frontend and/or backend web development, machine learning, IOS, Android, and much more. They have a great collection of courses taught by professionals, and I highly recommend it!

# 11. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?topic=Computer%20Science&index=prod_all_products_term_optimization&query=free)
Like EDX, Coursera hosts courses from top universities like Yale, Michigan, Stanford, and leading companies like Google and IBM.

# 12. [GitHub's Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
GitHub's lab is one of my favourite resources because they have lots of resources, and they are varied as well. First and foremost, you can learn essential skills: version control with Git.

Working as a developer means that you work with a version control system as well. It does not matter whether that's GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or any other system. These version control systems allow teams to track changes. Thus, on the GitHub's lab websites, you can learn about VCS by using GitHub.

Besides learning about VCS, you can learn about DevOps, language and tools such as:
* CircleCI, Travis CI
* HTML
* Node with Express
* Python
* Ruby

These are just some examples from their website, but you can learn more tools and technologies. **The best thing about this resource is the variety of tutorials!**

# 13. [Scotch](https://scotch.io)
On their homepage, they have the following description - *fun and practical web development tutorials*. That means you can learn about web development topics such as:

And many more. Besides that, Scotch has three free courses that teach you Vanilla JavaScript, Vue and React from scratch. Scotch is a great resource to learn about a wide variety of topics!

# 14. [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/)
Why bother to join the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) University when you can take their courses online? MIT offers great introductory courses to programming. Their courses are split into three categories:

* **General Introductions to Programming** - These courses introduce you to the principles of computer science. It also helps you begin to develop programming skills. It uses the Python programming language.
* **Language-Specific Courses** - Introductions to programming with other programming languages than Python.

# 16. [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
Even though it has CSS in its name and is one of the most popular CSS resources, CSS-Tricks covers other areas! Their website description is as follows - *Daily articles about CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and all things related to web design and development.*

Thus, you can learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web development and web design concepts. Additionally, it has a newsletter that curates the best news around web development.

# 17. [HTML Dog](https://www.htmldog.com)
The name "HTML Dog" is a bit misleading because you can learn about CSS and JavaScript too. That means you can learn about the three pillars of Web Development.

There are nine tutorials, three tutorials for each language. HTML, CSS and JavaScript tutorials are split into three levels:
* Beginner - Step-by-step guides taking you from 0.
* Intermediate - It teaches you more concepts, crossing the basic level.

If you want to learn Web Development, HTML Dog is a great resource! **The best thing about it is that it has a reference page.** That is, whenever you forget a concept, you can go back to the webpage and remind yourself about it.

# 18. [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com)
CoderByte is a website for coding challenges and technical interview preparation. In software development, practice is essential. Coding is about building stuff rather than memorizing concepts.

As a result, CoderByte is a great resource to practice what you learned using the other free resources. You can find:
* Data Structures and Algorithms coding problems

* JavaScript and Python material

Challenge your knowledge with CoderByte.

# 19. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**The best thing about it is that it has a page with trending articles from the development community.** Thus, you can find great articles that are outside Bento.

# Conclusion
These are the best places to learn coding for free I could find on the internet. Some of them help you learn concepts, while others allow you to practice what you learnt. I advise you to use them together, rather than picking one.
