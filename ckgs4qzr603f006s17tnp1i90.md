## Why Hashnode Is Different Than Other Blogging Platforms

I have using Hashnode for my blog since August, and I am impressed with everything it offers. So far, it has met all my needs. 

As a result, I am writing this article to show you why Hashnode is different than other blogging platforms. **This article is not promotional or whatsoever. When I enjoy a product, I like to promote it**. Thus, let's see what makes Hashnode different.

# Custom domain
One of the most important reasons is that you can have a personal domain. On most blogging platforms, you cannot do that, and it's a big turn off.

You own the content by having your domain, and it also looks more professional. Compare the two URLs:
* catalins.tech
* catalinpit.bloggingplatform.com

Do you agree that the first one looks more professional, and it is also easier to remember? This is one of the significant advantages of using Hashnode; you have your domain.

# Personalization and customization
Another vital feature is the ability to customize and personalize your blog. That means you can make your blog look and feel different. On other platforms, all the blogs look similar. There is nothing to differentiate the various blogs.

With Hashnode, you can add custom CSS, and thus modify your blog however you like. Being able to customize and personalize the blog is a deal-breaker for many, including myself.

# Community
When you start blogging, it's tough to bring readers to your blog. You might feel like you are blogging into a void because nobody reads your articles.

With Hashnode, you have a tightly-knit community that reads and interacts with your articles. But do not other blogging platforms have communities as well? Yes, they do. Hashnode is not unique in this aspect. The difference is that Hashnode is tightly-knit together.

Therefore, by joining Hashnode, you are less likely to blog into the void.

# No strings attached
You decide to move away from Hashnode? There are no strings attached. You can quickly back-up your posts on Github, and re-publish them somewhere else.

However, if Github is not something you use, you can also export the posts in `.json` format directly on your machine. You download them as you download other stuff from the internet.

Thus, Hashnode does not keep you tied to the platform.

# Other features
Above, I listed the features that I consider the most important. However, they are not the only features. There other essential features, such as having:
* A free built-in newsletter.
* Https by default.
* Faster Edge Caching.
* AMP Support.

The good thing is that it does not end here. People can always request features, which usually get implemented within days or weeks; depending on how useful and urgent they are. Thus, new features are continuously shipped.

# Conclusion
I hope the article is clear enough about why Hashnode is special. As I said previously, the article is not sponsored or paid. 

That does not mean Hashnode is the best either. It happens to be the best choice **for me**. It might not be for you. The other blogging platforms out there are excellent as well.
