## Hashnode Page Rules - Say goodbye to long and boring URLs ðŸ‘‹

Sometimes, links can become long and cumbersome. They look ugly, untrustworthy and spammy, which makes them difficult to share online.

However, Hashnode comes to the rescue. Hashnode has a feature, called **custom page rules**, that allows you to create a custom URL that redirects to another URL.

Thus, you can use your domain to create nice-looking, shorter URLs.

# Custom Page Rules

With the Hashnode custom page rules, you can create shorter URLs using your domain. Thus, instead of having one long URL, you can create a shorter URL with the following structure - `your_domain.com/yourPath`.

Let's take as an example this YouTube link - `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1IRCSmm74qhcFNPTHcbMg`, which represents my YouTube channel. I wanted to create something shorter and easier to remember.

As a result, I used the custom page rules to shorten the URL. Now, the URL to my YouTube channel is `https://catalins.tech/youtube`. Besides shortening the URL, it also makes it more intuitive.

Don't you agree that the URL looks better?

# How does it work?

When you create a redirect URL, you only need to provide the **path**. Hashnode automatically appends the path you provide to your domain (*as long as it's not taken already*).

For instance, if your domain is `blogger.com`, and you want to add the path `/youtube`, you only need to specify the path, and Hashnode appends it automatically to the domain.

After that, you need to select the redirect type you want. For example, you can choose a 301 or a 302 redirect type.

Lastly, you need to add the **destination URL**, which is the URL where your custom page rule will redirect people. After pressing the "Add rule" button, `blogger.com/youtube` will redirect to your YouTube channel.

Figure 1 below illustrates the process of creating a custom page rule. Thus, you can create your customized URLs within minutes.
