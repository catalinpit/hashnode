# What is Clerk?

With [Clerk](https://www.clerk.dev/?utm_source=hashnode&utm_medium=hackathon&utm_campaign=july_hack), you can add beautiful, high-conversion Sign Up and Sign In forms to your React application in minutes.  After signing in, Clerk empowers your users to take control of their account security with multi-factor authentication and device management. If you've ever found yourself thinking, "there's got to be a better way to build auth" - Clerk was built with you in mind.  

It truly only takes minutes to add best-in-class authentication experiences to your application - and Clerk's team is constantly working behind-the-scenes to make them even better.
