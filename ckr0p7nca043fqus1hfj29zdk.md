## üì∫ Live streaming with HarperDB Hackathon Winners

Hashnode wants to uplift the hackathon winners and highlight their projects. As a result, we plan on doing a live event on YouTube with the winners! 

What does that mean? It means that **hackathon winners will have a chance to present their projects in front of other developers**. We think it's a great way to celebrate!

**Why do we do it?** The hackathon participants spent weeks researching, planning, building and documenting their projects. Thus, we want to give the winners the chance to showcase their work to the developer community. 

By doing so, they might motivate other developers to take action, and it might even land them opportunities - collaborations, internships or even a full-time opportunity.
