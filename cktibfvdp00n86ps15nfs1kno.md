Let's take a look at the key features of the app that make it unique from Hashnode's desktop experience.

### **Seamlessly interact with articles** ✍

On the web app, you need to sign in before interacting with blogs on custom domains for the first time. 

On the mobile app, that's gone! There is **no extra step to interact** with bloggers and readers!

### **Easily bookmark articles** 🔖

With the mobile application, you can bookmark an article with one tap. **Did an article catch your attention, but you are short on time?** Bookmark it from the home screen and come back later to read it. 

Accessing your bookmarks is as easy as bookmarking them. Simply tap on the **Bookmarks** option and see all the saved articles!

### **Engage with your readers** 🤳

It's easy to miss notifications from your blog readers and forget to interact back with them. You do not want your readers to feel neglected!

The app enables you to easily keep track of your notifications on the go, so you can be alerted anytime your audience interacts with you. Even better, you can interact back by reacting and replying to them!

### **Never miss great articles** 🎯

Instead of mindless scrolling social media apps, you can read an article on the Hashnode mobile app and learn something new.

But that's not all! Other notable features include:
- Mark all notifications as read
- View tag feed by going to search results for tags
- Open links from the article screen
- Open author's blog from article screen

## What's coming next ⌛

This is just the warm-up! Expect to see continuous updates to make the native experience even better.

We are already working on more cool features such as:
* **Mobile editor**📝 - That means you can write and publish articles directly from the mobile application. No more lost ideas! Whenever the inspiration strikes, you can open the app and write!
* **Draft list** 📃 - See all your drafts from the mobile app. Do you want to continue working on an article? Do it straight from the app.
* **Preview mode** 🔎 - You will be able to preview your drafts on your mobile phone.
* **Dark mode** 🌑 - And the favorite feature of all developers! Soon the mobile application will support dark mode too.

We are really excited about the mobile application, and we believe it will help the community connect more & better!

We are eager to hear what you think. Please let us know in the comments!
