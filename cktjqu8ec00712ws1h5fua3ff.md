## 14 Best Web Developer Portfolios To Get Inspiration

For web developers, a personal portfolio page is like a resume. Instead of listing your skills on a resume in the traditional way, you can prove your competence with a personal portfolio.

When people or potential employers see your portfolio, they can get a glimpse of your skills. Thus, **online portfolios are a great way to showcase your work and skills**.

However, creating an online portfolio is not straightforward for everyone. For example, you might struggle with questions such as:
* What should I add to my portfolio?
* How should I structure it?
* What technologies should I use to build it?

As a result, I want to help you answer any questions you might have. In this article, you can see my favourite web developer portfolios from the internet. Hopefully, they will answer your questions and inspire you to create your online portfolio.

## 2. Lynn Fisher

Lynn is a developer, digital illustrator and UI/UX designer, according to her portfolio. 

On Lynn's page, you can read more about her and the work she's doing. She also writes articles so you can learn from her!

An interesting fact about Lynn's portfolio is that it changes every year. You can see all the previous iterations if you go to the [archive page](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/).

![A screenshot of lynnandtonic.com website](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631444706904/yfCB7esc0.png)

I want to highlight something from the archive page. If you visit that page, you should see the following:

> I call it my "annual portfolio refresh" and use it as an opportunity to try new things and continue learning.

That's something we all should note down! We should take advantage of the opportunities that allow us to learn something and never stop learning. With that being said, see [Lynn's portfolio page](https://lynnandtonic.com) in action.

Annie was previously a Designer, but she changed careers and became a Developer. Looking at her portfolio, you can see that she was previously a Designer because it looks beautiful!

Annie's portfolio is colourful, and it has personality. Even though it uses a multitude of colours, they work well together.

One thing I like and do not see in other portfolios are the testimonials. Annie included testimonials from people she collaborated with. It's a great way to establish credibility and show proof of your competence.
