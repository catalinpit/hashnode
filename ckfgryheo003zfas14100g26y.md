Even though the resources from the article are aimed at beginners, experienced developers can use them as well. Most of them have sections designed for experienced developers too.

Thus, let us see what the resources are:
1. FreeCodeCamp
2. FrontEnd Masters
3. You Don't Know JavaScript
4. Exercism
6. JavaScript30
7. JavaScript.info

# FreeCodeCamp
The first resource on the list is FreeCodeCamp, which provides an excellent introduction to JavaScript. On top of that, it dives into advanced topics as well. Thus, you can go from no knowledge to an intermediate level.

FreeCodeCamp takes you from the absolute basics, like declaring variables, to advanced topics such as functional programming. The JavaScript topics they cover are:
* Basic JavaScript
* ES6
* Regular Expressions
* Debugging
* Basic Data Structures
* Basic Algorithm Scripting
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Functional Programming
* Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
* JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

Looking at the list above, we can say that FreeCodeCamp is more than enough to start with if you are a beginner. Besides that, it is useful even if you have experience as a developer because it covers advanced topics too. Additionally, they have a YouTube channel also, where they post tutorials. For example, you could follow the curriculum on their website and supplement your learning with the material from their YouTube channel. 

Thus, you can go from a beginner level to an advanced level just by using the FreeCodeCamp platform and their YouTube channel.

and more. 

Do not let the name fool you. Frontend Masters is not just for frontend developers or for people looking to become frontend developers. You can learn backend technologies like Node, GraphQl, or databases such as MongoDB or sysadmin/DevOps stuff like AWS. They even have a "Fullstack" path where you learn a lot of complex things.

Why is the platform worth it? First of all, professional developers are teaching the courses. That means, the information is legitimate, and of high quality. Secondly, there is a large variety of courses. There are courses covering frontend, backend, and sysops topics. You can learn anything.

# You Don't Know JavaScript
The book series "You Don't Know JavaScript" is one of the best resources to learn JavaScript. This series is split into six books, and it takes you from zero knowledge to an advanced level. It teaches you about the scope, closures, "this" keyword, object prototype, types & grammar, async, performance, and ES6 & beyond.

The good thing is that, like FreeCodeCamp, YDKJS series is free. However, there are hard copies of the books as well, which are paid. Of course, you can buy them to support the author if you can afford it.

The "You Don't Know JavaScript" series is my go-to manual. Whenever I want to refresh concepts or learn new ones, I use this resource first. It is well-written, detailed, to the point, and always following the ECMAScript specification.

# Exercism.io
Exercism is different in the sense that it is a coding challenges website. Nonetheless, it is beneficial to put into practice what you learn.

The most useful feature of Exercism is that they assign you a mentor. That is, each time you submit a challenge, a mentor checks it for you, and it approves it or suggests changes. Having a mentor is incredibly valuable, and you progress faster. A mentor can guide you and tell you how and where to improve. It is something that helps you tremendously.

Therefore, Exercism is an excellent platform for beginners for the fact that you have mentors.

# JavaScript30
Building applications yourself is essential in programming. No matter how much theory you know, you need to build stuff to learn and improve your skills. As a result, we have JavaScript30, which focuses exclusively on building JavaScript applications. It does not use any frameworks, compilers, or boilerplates. It is purely vanilla JavaScript.

The JavaScript30 course is for beginners and intermediates. It is teaching you the JavaScript fundamentals and how to work with the Document Object Model (DOM). Bear in mind; you should already have basic JavaScript knowledge before starting the course. The purpose of the course is to make you apply that knowledge.

JavaScript30 is entirely free, as well. You only need perseverance, consistency and willing to code.

# JavaScript.info
JavaScript.info is a resource you can use as your primary learning resource or as a reference. It contains information on JavaScript fundamentals, advanced concepts, and Document Object Model. In other words, it covers almost everything you need to know about JavaScript.

The website is split into three parts:
1. **The JavaScript Language** – start from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like OOP. The focus is on the language itself here.
2. **Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces** – learn how to manage the browser page: add elements, manipulate their size and position, dynamically create interfaces and interact with the visitor.
3. **Additional Articles** – a list of extra topics that assume you've covered the first two parts of the tutorial. There is no clear hierarchy here; you can read articles in the order you want.

The information is dense, and to the point. You can use the website as your primary study guide, or you can use it in conjuncture with the other resources.

It is important to note that the list in this article is not exhaustive. There are many other resources on the internet to learn JavaScript. However, they are some of the best resources, based on their feedback and popularity.

Even better, they are entirely free except for the hard copies of YDKJS, which you can buy if you want to support the author. Frontend Masters requires a membership too.
