## Websites That Pay You To Write Technical Articles

Getting paid to write technical articles is a great way to supplement your income. Especially if you already write articles for your blog. However, the first question that arises is "*how can I get opportunities?*", which was my question too. 

As a result, I want to list a handful of websites that pay you to write technical articles for them. You can see their name, the URL, and the approximate sum they pay you.

# Sources
Be aware; I did not come with this list of publications. I put together (most of) the publications from [Paid Community Writer Programs](https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms), and [Who Pays Technical Writers](https://whopaystechnicalwriters.com/) together. **Also, in the article you can see some of the most popular publications. For a more comprehensive list, with more publications, visit the above links**.

Therefore, I hope it helps you to create an additional income. Also, keep an eye on these two sources in case they add more publications.
